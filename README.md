Hi there. This is Anton Cataldi's WilloTree Coding Challenge Submission. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Relevant files are located in the src/ directory. In addition, I utilized the
'react-router' package for routing between different pages and the 'redux' and
'react-redux' packages for state management. 'axios' is for http requests and
'bootstrap' for styling.

To execute, simply run commands 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. The
application will be launched on 'localhost:3000' . Have fun!
